title: "Agentic Tier-1 SOC Expands Coverage Without Adding Headcount"

Coverage gaps usually appear when alert queues spike, new detectors ship, or new data sources come online. Human-only Tier-1 teams throttle on staffing limits. Agent-based Tier-1 keeps coverage high without hiring cycles.

Why it matters:

- **Elastic scaling**: Agents absorb bursty queues from IR drills, red-team exercises, or real attacks.
- **Onboard-any-source**: New telemetry (identity, endpoint, network, SaaS) is routed and enriched automatically.
- **Fewer dropped alerts**: Automated correlation collapses duplicates and near-duplicates before humans see them.
- **Higher signal-to-noise**: Agents map to MITRE ATT&CK and apply confidence scoring before analysts read the case.

The future SOC is a fabric, not a shift schedule—agents keep every source covered while humans supervise and tune.
