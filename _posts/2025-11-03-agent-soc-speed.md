title: "Speed Is the New SLA: Agentic Tier-1 SOC"

Dwell time shrinks when Tier-1 decisions land in seconds, not minutes. Agents accelerate the front of the funnel so containment happens while attackers are still moving.

Reasons to adopt:

- **Instant enrichment**: Whois, VT, EDR pivots, IAM lookups, and ticket context are pulled before human eyes land.
- **Timeline-first triage**: Agents assemble incident timelines automatically, so analysts validate rather than compile.
- **Faster decisions**: Pre-baked recommendations (block, isolate, disable, ticket) arrive with justification.
- **Continuous response**: Agents run 24/7 without handoff gaps; humans review exceptions and high-risk branches.

Future SOC performance will be measured by time-to-contain, not time-to-open. Agentic Tier-1 sets the pace.
