title: "Governance Built In: Why Agentic Tier-1 Is Safer"

Automation must be auditable. Agent-based Tier-1 SOCs bring structure and transparency that ad hoc human triage often lacks.

Governance wins:

- **Policy-driven actions**: Playbooks encode who can auto-block, isolate, or disable—and when approvals are required.
- **Evidence logging**: Every enrichment, query, and decision is logged for compliance review.
- **Explainability**: Agents attach rationale with MITRE ATT&CK mapping so reviewers see why a call was made.
- **Safer delegation**: Junior analysts can supervise agentic flows with clear guardrails instead of freeform actions.

Future SOCs need both speed and control. Agentic Tier-1 makes automation reviewable, auditable, and policy-aligned.
