# Stratoclo

Agentic AI for security teams.  
Turn noisy alerts into clear, actionable incident stories.

---

## What is Stratoclo?

Stratoclo is a security co-pilot that works alongside your existing tools. It:

- Ingests alerts, logs, and context from multiple sources  
- Normalizes and correlates them into a single incident timeline  
- Provides clear explanations of attacker behavior  
- Recommends next actions based on the evidence  

It operates like a virtual Tier-1 and Tier-2 SOC analyst.

## Product Demo — What You Will See

The demo walks through a realistic multi-alert incident.

1. **Ingest**  
   Stratoclo collects alerts from endpoint, network, identity, and cloud tools, then automatically groups them into a single incident.

2. **Enrich**  
   Hostnames, users, IPs, hashes, and file paths are enriched with threat intelligence and internal context.  
   The result is a unified and chronological incident timeline.

3. **Explain**  
   Stratoclo produces a written summary explaining what happened, which systems are affected, and why the event matters.

4. **Recommend**  
   The system identifies practical next steps:  
   what to block, isolate, investigate further, or close as low-risk.

5. **Collaborate**  
   Shareable summaries are produced for tickets and team communication platforms.  
   Executive-level and technical summaries are both generated.

## Why Stratoclo?

- Reduces alert fatigue by grouping related signals into fewer, higher-quality incidents  
- Accelerates triage and investigation  
- Helps less experienced analysts ramp up quickly  
- Works with existing SIEM, XDR, and logging platforms  
- Does not require replacing any of your current tools  

---

## Who Is This For?

- MSSPs and MDR providers  
- Enterprise SOC teams  
- Security engineers at growing startups  
- Builders exploring agentic-AI-driven security operations  

---

## How the Demo Works

In the interactive demo, you will:

- Provide a small set of alerts or logs  
- Allow Stratoclo to automatically build the incident storyline  
- Ask questions in natural language such as:  
  “How did the attacker get in?”  
  “Which accounts are involved?”  
  “What should be done next?”

This is an early-stage prototype focused on workflow design, investigation quality, and AI-driven reasoning.

## Roadmap

- Deeper integrations with major SIEM, XDR, and ticketing platforms  
- Expanded agentic AI investigation playbooks  
- Incident trend analysis and reporting capabilities  
- Enterprise-grade access controls, auditing, and data handling
